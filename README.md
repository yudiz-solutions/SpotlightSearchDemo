With iOS 9, Apple bring many new things for iOS developer. Let’s talk about spotlight search.In iOS 9 new frame work added called “Core Spotlight”  which is used to add our app information searchable in spotlight search.

There are 2 way to  indexes:

# 1) A private on-device index
 -  Each device contains a private index whose information is never shared with Apple or synced between devices. When you make an item available in a user’s on-device index, only that user can view the item in search results. 

# 2) Apple’s server-side index
 -  The server-side index stores only publicly available data that you’ve marked appropriately on your website.
